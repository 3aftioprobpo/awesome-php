However, finding and playing these games today can be challenging, as they are rare and require special hardware and software to run. Fortunately, there is a solution: emulation. Emulation is a process that allows you to run software designed for one system on another system, such as your PC. By using an emulator program and ROM files, you can enjoy NEC PC 6001 games on your computer without any hassle.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and play NEC PC 6001 games on your computer using an emulator called M88. M88 is one of the best emulators for the PC 6001 series, as it supports all models and features of the original hardware, such as graphics modes, sound chips, voice synthesis, and floppy disk drives. M88 also has a user-friendly interface and various options to customize your gaming experience.
 
## Step 1: Download M88 and ROMs
 
The first step is to download M88 and ROMs for the games you want to play. You can find M88 on its official website, where you can choose between the Windows or DOS version. The Windows version is recommended for most users, as it has more features and compatibility than the DOS version.
 
As for ROMs, they are files that contain the data of the original game cartridges or disks. You can find a large collection of NEC PC 6001 ROMs on The Old Computer[^1^], a website that hosts thousands of retro games for various systems. You can browse by system, genre, or alphabetically, and download the ROMs you want. Alternatively, you can also check out Neo Kobe[^2^], an archive project that aims to preserve all Japanese computer games from the 1980s and 1990s. Neo Kobe has a comprehensive set of PC 6001 games with detailed information and screenshots.
 
Once you have downloaded M88 and ROMs, you need to extract them using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should have a folder with M88.exe and some subfolders with ROM files.
 
## Step 2: Configure M88
 
The next step is to configure M88 to run the games properly. To do this, launch M88.exe and go to the Config menu. Here you can adjust various settings related to the emulation, such as:
 
- System: Here you can select which model of PC 6001 you want to emulate. You can choose between PC-6001 (1981), PC-6001mkII (1983), PC-6601 (1983), PC-6001mkIISR (1984), or PC-6601SR (1984). Each model has different specifications and capabilities, so you should select the one that matches the game you want to play. For example, if you want to play Tiny Xevious[^1^], which was released for the PC-6001mkII with voice synthesis support, you should select PC-6001mkII + Voice.
- Display: Here you can change the size and quality of the game screen. You can choose between windowed or full-screen mode, zoom in or out, enable scanlines or smoothing effects, and adjust the brightness and contrast.
- Sound: Here you can enable or disable sound output and choose which sound chip to use. The PC 6001 series had various sound chips depending on the model and expansion options, such as PSG (Programmable Sound Generator), FM (Frequency Modulation), or SSG (Software Sound Generator). You should select the sound chip that matches the game you want to play. For example, if you want to play The Black Onyx, which was released for 0f148eb4a0
